    <h3>Academic Projects:</h3>
    <h4>Generation of Electricity Using Trash:-</h4>
    <p>In his project we show how to generate electricity by waste materials and how to control pollution by pollution control filters which is eventually beneficial for government as well as public also. </p> 
    
    <h4>Solar Tracking System:-</h4>
    <p>Solar systems which tracks the changes in sun's trajectory over the course of the day collect a for greater amount of solar energy, and therefore generates a significantly higher output power. This projecct may be useful to improve the design characteristis of different types of solar tracking systems to improve performance.</p>
